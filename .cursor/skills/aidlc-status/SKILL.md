# AI-DLC status

Show the current workflow status through the same deterministic route as
`/aidlc --status`.

1. Run:

   ```bash
   aidlc engine orchestrate next --status
   ```

2. Act on the returned directive exactly as the `aidlc` skill's forwarding
   loop describes. The expected terminal `print` directive names the read-only
   status command: run that command, print its stdout verbatim, and stop.

Never print the directive JSON as the status report, and never advance or
mutate workflow state.
